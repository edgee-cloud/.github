## Hi there 👋

Welcome to **Edgee**.

We’re building an **edge-native AI Gateway**: a unified, OpenAI-compatible API that sits between your app and LLM providers to add **routing**, **reliability**, **observability**, and **privacy controls**—without locking you into a single vendor.

### What Edgee AI Gateway is for
When you run AI in production, the “best model” changes constantly (cost, latency, availability, region, compliance). Edgee helps you:

- **Use one API** across providers and models
- **Route by policy** (cost/latency/quality/region), with **fallbacks & retries**
- **Observe everything** (latency, errors, usage, cost) and export it
- **Control privacy** with configurable logging/retention (and provider-side ZDR where available)
- **Bring your own keys (BYOK)** if you want to keep direct provider relationships

> Status: the AI Gateway is under active development and shipping incrementally. We aim to be explicit about what’s available vs in-progress.
