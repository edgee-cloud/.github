## Hi there 👋

Welcome to **Edgee**.

We’re building an **edge-native AI Gateway**: a unified, OpenAI-compatible API that sits between your app and LLM providers to add **routing**, **reliability**, **observability**, and **privacy controls**, without locking you into a single vendor.
> Status: the AI Gateway is under active development and shipping incrementally. We aim to be explicit about what’s available vs in-progress.
